# Producer_Consumer

<H2> Problem</H2>
To make sure that the producer won’t try to add data into the buffer if it’s full and that the consumer won’t try to remove data from an empty buffer.


<H2>Implementation of Producer Consumer Class </H2>

A LinkedList list – to store list of jobs in queue.
A Variable Capacity – to check for if the list is full or not
A mechanism to control the insertion and extraction from this list so that we do not insert into list if it is full or remove from it if it is empty.
